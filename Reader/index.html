        Buried in the controversy this summer about Google's LaMDA language model, which an engineer claimed was sentient, is a hint about a big change that's come over artificial intelligence since Alan Turing defined the idea of the "Turing Test" in an essay in 1950.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        Turing, a British mathematician who laid the groundwork for computing, offered what he called the "Imitation Game." Two entities, one a person, one a digital computer, are asked questions by a third entity, a human interrogator. The interrogator can't see the other two, and has to figure out simply from their type-written answers which of the two is human and which machine.

        Why not, suggested Turing, let behavior settle the matter. If it answers like a human, then it can be credited with thinking.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        Turing was sure that machines would get so good at the Turing Test that by the year 2000, "one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted."

        A funny thing happened on the way to the future. Humans, it turns out, are spending more and more of their time inside of the world of machines, rather than the other way around.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        Increasingly, humans spend their time doing stuff that a machine could do just as well if not better. One of the many achievements of modern software is to occupy people's time with easy tasks, such as the busy work you do on social media, things like posting, commenting, "liking," and Snapping. 
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        It's obvious that given half a chance, most machines could replicate social media behavior flawlessly. Not because programs such as OpenAI's GPT-3 language program are human-like, but because the low bar to interacting on social media has redefined what we might accept as "human" behavior.

        If the average individual ascribes intelligence to AI, it is because the average individual spends more and more of their time engaging in online tasks that a machine could easily emulate.
